<p>
  In this post I want to show you two different strategies for adding Google&rsquo;s new image format <a target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link--content" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/">WebP</a>, and the legacy
  browser issues to be considered in your implementation. As part of your web page optimization to-do list, you will want
  to decrease image download sizes and this where WebP will help you. WebP offers considerable image size reductions for
  your site and while browser support is not ideal yet, should definitely be considered. Check out <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
    class="link--content" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/gallery">this link</a> to compare the quality difference
  between original images and WebP converted.

  <p>WebP lossless images are 26% smaller in size compared to PNGs. WebP lossy images are 25-34% smaller than comparable JPEG
    images at equivalent SSIM quality index.</p>

<h5>Creating WebP Images</h5>

<p>Here are some tools to help you convert your png and jpeg images to WebP format, WebP support both lossy (JPEG) and lossless
  (PNG,GIF) compression.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link--content" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/download">cwebp</a>    command line encoder tool to convert images to WebP</li>
  <li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link--content" href="http://www.romeolight.com/products/webpconv/">WebPconv</a>    Handy desktop tool to drag and drop multiple images into, will batch convert to WebP and also vice versa if you wish
    ( I use this one ! )</li>
</ul>

<p>For Webpack user keep in mind by default webpack won't recognize the <code>.webp</code> extension and throw an error, but
  you simply need to add the image extension to your image / file loader extension test.</p>

<div class="breakout">
  <div class="breakout-wrapper">
    <Highlight type="javascript" code="{
  test: /\.(woff2?|ttf|eot|jpg|jpeg|png|gif|webp)(\?.*)?$/i,
  use: [
    {
      loader: 'file-loader',
      options: {
        name: 'assets/[name].[ext]'
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}"></Highlight>
  </div>
</div>

<h5>Adding WebP from Html</h5>

<p>
  Adding images to your html has always been a straightforward process, you simple add an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag in
  your html and in the src you would specify the image to download. This would take any valid popular image format i.e. png,
  jpeg, svg etc&hellip; and you were done. Now a WebP image is just another image format, so you would be tempted to just
  place this new image extension straight in the <code>src</code> of an img tag.
</p>

<p>But not every browser supports WebP <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link--content" href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=webp">yet</a>,
  currently limited Chrome, Opera and Android. For example if you would try to load a WebP image in Firefox, the request
  would fail and no image would be displayed. To handle these unsupported browsers, we need to also specify a fallback image
  which can be rendered by the browser. For this kind of flexibility we need the HTML 5 <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> tag.</p>

<div class="breakout">
  <div class="breakout-wrapper">
    <Highlight type="xml" code="<picture>
  <source type=''image/webp'' srcset=''your_image.webp'' />
  <img
    src=''your_image.png''
    class=''profile__img''
    alt=''WebP for supported Browser, otherwise png will load''
  />
</picture>"></Highlight>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In the above example we added the source tag to specify the WebP image with the correct type, which is defined as MIME Type
  <strong>image/webp</strong>, and <code>srcset</code> to point to the location of the WebP image. We still have to load
  the img tag which then loads the alternative file for unsupported browsers, but for supported browsers img source will
  be
  <strong>replaced</strong> by the <code>srcset</code> of the WebP <code>source</code> tag&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;Pretty cool!
</p>

<p>Browser support for <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> is very good as of today, with just Internet Explorer lagging behind (Edge
  does support it). But fear not since there is a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link--content" href="https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill">polyfill</a>  for everything these days, but even without the polyfill these browsers would still fallback to the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>  tag. </p>

<p>Make sure that the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag is specified last, since browsers will pick the first matching element and
  ignore subsequent sources. Note that even the css class, alt etc on the img tag will persist and will be applied to your
  WebP image.</p>

<h5>Adding WebP from CSS</h5>

<p>
  Next up is setting WebP as background images in CSS, where similar considerations are required. First we need to a way to
  detect in our css file if a certain browser can load WebP as a background image or not.
</p>

<p>
  To do this we need to add a small <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link--content" href="https://modernizr.com/">Modernizr</a>  script to detect the browser support for WebP, which will then add appropriate classes to your html page. We can then use
  these hints to load the correct image in our css. Download the required WebP detect script from the Modernizr website and
  then import into your app&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;around 3.4 KB before gzip.
</p>

<p>When your page is loaded you should then see either the <code>.webp</code> or <code>.no-webp</code> css class added to your
  page html tag</p>

<figure>
  <div class="blog__img">
    <picture>
      <source type="image/webp" srcset='/assets/blogs/webp_available.webp' />
      <img src='/assets/blogs/webp_available.png' alt="Service Worker in Network Tab" />
    </picture>
  </div>
  <figcaption>.webp class is added when supported.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <div class="blog__img">
    <picture>
      <source type="image/webp" srcset='/assets/blogs/webp_not_available.webp' />
      <img src='/assets/blogs/webp_not_available.png' alt="Service Worker in Network Tab" />
    </picture>
  </div>
  <figcaption>.no-webp class is added when not supported.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>With these helpers in place, you now have all you need to switch the <code>background-image</code> depending on browser support.
  Also note that user might have javascript disabled, in which case you could extend the below class to <code>.no-js, .no-webp</code>.
</p>


<div class="breakout">
  <div class="breakout-wrapper">
    <Highlight type="css" code="/* No WebP Support i.e. Firefox */
.no-webp .container { 
  background-image: url('/img/your_image.png'); 
} 

/* WebP Support i.e. Chrome */
.webp .container { 
  background-image: url('/img/your_image.webp'); 
}"></Highlight>
  </div>
</div>

<h5>Little Gotchas</h5>

<p>When you are deploying your site you will more than likely need to add the <strong>image/webp</strong> MIME type as valid
  content type. For example on this site hosted on Amazon S3, all my WebP images initially had a default content type of
  <code>application/octet-stream</code>.
</p>

<h5>Conclusion</h5>

<p>
  In my opinion there is a clear benefit to adapting the above techniques, quicker download times for your users is a no brainer
  &mdash; when available. There are definitely mixed feelings in the web community about WebP, which has been around since
  2010 when Google purchased On2 Technologies, and I am not sure if it will be ever supported by all major browsers. Firefox
  has recently <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link--content" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1294490">re-opened</a>  the case for supporting WebP, but it might require a specific <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link--content"
    href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/firefox-will-support-google-s-super-tiny-webp-image-format-507622.shtml">browser setting</a>  to be enabled manually&mdash;so not so sure how useful that would be.
</p>

<p>Downloading images is a huge bottleneck for websites&rsquo; bandwith, so any improvements that can be made in this area is
  a win for your hosting costs and your users&rsquo; experience. Try it out and see the improvements for yourself&mdash;on
  Chrome browsers anyway.</p>
