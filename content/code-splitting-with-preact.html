	One of the main performance gains you can make these days is by controlling the amount of javascript you ship to your users.
	The idea is to stay away from shipping your entire javascript codebase into one single large bundle, which the user has
	re-download entirely on any code change. Plus the fact that the user is downloading javascript which may not even required
	by the page in question and may not ever be required, hurting down their initial page download and ultimately the user experience.
</p>

<p>
	To help your users out, I will show a few techniques using
	<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link--content" href="https://webpack.js.org">Webpack</a> and
	<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link--content" href="https://preactjs.com/">Preact</a> to use code splitting to minimize the javascript the user is forced to download and dynamically load further
	required bundles when needed. Code splitting can be used to load many javascript bundles (i.e. your app and vendor bundle)
	in parallel or on demand.
</p>

<p>
	In this article I will mainly focus on the on demand bundles, since there is a lot of documentation out there already how
	to just create static separate entry bundles in Webpack. Don&rsquo;t worry a lot of this sounds a lot scarier than it really
	is, webpack runtime does most out of this magic out of the box. All you have to do is define your split points.
</p>

<funky-h5>On Demand code splitting set up</funky-h5>

<ul>
	<li>
		<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link--content" href="https://webpack.js.org">Webpack</a> is the main requirement, and I am using version 3.3.0.</li>
	<li>
		<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link--content" href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel ES2015</a> set up to support
		<code>import()</code> to dynamically load ES6 modules, your project will also need a polyfill for
		<code>Promise()</code>.</li>
	<li>
		<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link--content" href="https://github.com/prateekbh/preact-async-route">Preact Async Router</a> is used for route based code splitting.</li>
</ul>

<funky-h5>Import</funky-h5>

<p>The key functionality to all of the module loading methods below stems from the module loader API method
	<code>import()</code>, which is not part of the ES6 standard but a sort of extension of it called "Javascript Loader Standard" currently being
	drafted. This method will allows us to dynamically load ES6 modules via the module loader api based on ES6
	<code>Promises</code>.
</p>

<funky-h5>Route based code splitting</funky-h5>

<p>Using Preact Async Router we can define our main page routes and define what component to lazy-load when that route is requested.
	All you need to do is pass a function to the
	<code>AsyncRoute</code> getComponent prop which will return load your lazy-loaded requested component.
</p>

<div class="breakout">
	<div class="breakout-wrapper">
		<Highlight type="xml" code="<Router>
  <Home path='/' />
  <AsyncRoute path=''/about'' getComponent={this.About} />
  <AsyncRoute path=''/favourites'' getComponent={this.Favourites} />
  <AsyncRoute path=''/writing'' getComponent={this.Writing}         />
</Router>"></Highlight>
	</div>
</div>

<p>The difference here is subtle, normally you would just import the component on the top of the page and pass as a prop to
	the route but this would mean that component would get included into one of your main static bundles.</p>

<p>Now we are saying
	<strong>I want you to create a separate bundle for this component</strong>, and only ever load this bundle if the user actually
	visits this route. Please note the comment within
	<code>import()</code>, this is a special webpack feature to give your javascript chunks a nicer name.</p>

<div class="breakout">
	<div class="breakout-wrapper">
		<Highlight type="javascript" code="/* No longer doing this... */
import Favourites from './favourites';

/* But now using ES6 Import to create a new split point */
Favourites = async () => {
  const module = await import(
     /* webpackChunkName: ''chunk-favourite'' */ './favourites'
  );
  return module.default;
};">
		</Highlight>
	</div>
</div>

<p>
	<strong>Note: </strong> When the promise returning from
	<code>import()</code> resolves, you need to return the
	<code>.default</code> since that will actually contain the module you want to load. </p>

<funky-h5>Component based code splitting</funky-h5>

<p>You might also run into a situation, where you want to lazy-load some logic but not based on routes but rather event driven.
	One common example in the Preact or React world might be based on a component lifecycle event i.e.
	<code>ComponentDidMount</code>.</p>


<div class="breakout">
	<div class="breakout-wrapper">
		<Highlight type="javascript" code="async componentDidMount() {
  const contactMe = await import(
    /* webpackChunkName: ''chunk-contactme'' */ './Contact'
  );
  this.Contact = contactMe.default;
}

render() {
  ...
  // The && check is added here to prevent <undefined></undefined> being outputted.
  { this.Contact && <this.Contact displayShowMe={displayShowMe} /> }
  ...
}">
		</Highlight>
	</div>
</div>

<p>Another example might be based on a user event like clicking a button, this works similar to the above example but we just
	use
	<code>componentWillReceiveProps</code> lifecycle event.</p>

<div class="breakout">
	<div class="breakout-wrapper">
		<Highlight type="javascript" code="async componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {
  if (nextProps.displayShowMe && !this.Contact) {
    const contactMe = await import(
      /* webpackChunkName: ''chunk-contactme'' */ './Contact'
    );
    this.Contact = contactMe.default;
    // forceUpdate() required to call render
    this.forceUpdate();
  }
}

render({ showAboutMe, displayShowMe }) {
  <button onClick={showAboutMe} />
  {this.Contact && <this.Contact displayShowMe={displayShowMe} />}
}">
		</Highlight>
	</div>
</div>

<funky-h5>Resource Hints</funky-h5>

<p>Another good performance boost would be to add resource hints in your index.html for these dynamic chunks you have created,
	these will allow the browser to prefetch these chunks (while idle) in the background resulting in a quicker page load when
	requested.
</p>

<p>There are a few webpack plugins to help you achieve this, I personally use this
	<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link--content" href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/preload-webpack-plugin">preload-webpack</a> plugin.</p>

<funky-h5>Conclusion</funky-h5>

<p>By following the steps above, this is the end results for my webpack output here at
	<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link--content" href="https://stevenfitzpatrick.io">stevenfitzpatrick.io</a>. Admittedly, this is a tiny site and a lot of these are small bundle sizes and not really necessary
	to separate. But I believe it&rsquo;s a good principle to only load what you need, and keep your page load resources at
	a minimum.</p>
