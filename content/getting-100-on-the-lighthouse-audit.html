<p>
  While working on a recent website and looking to improve page optimization/performance, I came came across a new plugin released
  by Google called <a class="link--content" href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/">Lighthouse </a>.
  The Lighthouse tool will basically run a report on your website, and test your site for a whole list of web performance
  standards. Conveniently, it will also then let you know what your page is missing and what areas need improvement.
</p>

<p>
  The main aim is to get your website to a <strong>Progressive Web Application</strong> or <abbr title="Progressive Web Application">PWA</abbr>  level. If you don&rsquo;t know anything about PWA&rsquo;s, this is a good introductory <a class="link--content" href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/">link</a>.
  Progressive Web Apps are built to be fast, feel native on mobile (you can also add <abbr title="Progressive Web Application">PWA</abbr>&rsquo;s
  to your Android&rsquo;s Homescreen) and work under any network condition.
</p>

<p>
  You can run the Lighouse tools in several ways, straight from the command line, a plugin part of your build process (i.e.
  webpack) or maybe most convenienly as a Chrome Extension. With the Chrome Extension all you need to do is browse to page
  you want to check and click on the Lighthouse Icon (Just make sure you don&rsquo;t have page open in multiple tabs). As
  soon as you do it, the extension will take over and run your page against a barrage of tests. If you don&rsquo;t get a
  full green report the first time don&rsquo;t worry, a lot of the items are quite new in web development and most sites
  out there would currently not pass this test.
</p>

<p>
  So, I will try and help guide you on the path to a full 100/100 score on the Lighouse report. Starting with a few basic items
  that you will need that I bet your site doesn&rsquo;t currently have.
</p>

<h5>Service Worker</h5>

<p>
  Adding a Service Worker is key for any <abbr title="Progressive Web Application">PWA</abbr>, this is what will allows us
  to deliver a great user experience under any network condition &mdash; hello offline first. The Service Worker will allows
  you to control the caching strategy for your website, putting you back in control how your website should load it&rsquo;s
  resources and requests. If you don&rsquo;t know anything about Service Workers, you might be wondering how you actually
  add a Service Worker to your site.
</p>

<p>The good news is that adding a Service Worker to your site is relatively easing, and there is great tooling out there to
  get help you get started.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a class="link--content" href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache">sw-precache</a> Node module to generate a
    service worker, produced by Google.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a class="link--content" href="https://github.com/goldhand/sw-precache-webpack-plugin">SW Precache Webpack Plugin</a>    Webpack wrapper around sw-precache (Used on this site) .
  </li>
  <li>
    <a class="link--content" href="https://github.com/NekR/offline-plugin">offline-plugin</a> Another one for webpack users.
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>Manifest File</h5>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, one of the main features of <abbr title="Progressive Web Application">PWA</abbr> is to get your web
  app have a native feel on mobile. Here is where the manifest file comes into play. Again very simple to set up, just a
  manifest.json to the root of your project and then link to the manifest file from your index.html. It is a simple JSON
  file, with a large list of possible <a class="link--content" href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2014/11/Support-for-installable-web-apps-with-webapp-manifest-in-chrome-38-for-Android">configurations</a>  which let you control how your app would be displayed on mobile. Items such as the icons, launch screen, theme colour,
  short name for the app etc. Here is the list of minimum required settings for the Lighthouse test.
</p>
<div class="breakout">
  <div class="breakout-wrapper">
    <Highlight type="javascript" code="// Simply add the link the manifest.json file in the <head> of your index.html
<link rel=''manifest'' href=''/manifest.json''>"></Highlight>
  </div>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>
    Contains start_url.
  </li>
  <li>
    Links to icon images in 64&times;64 and 192&times;192 sizes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Background &amp; Theme color
  </li>
  <li>
    Theme color
  </li>
  <li>
    Name &amp; Short Name for your app (max 12 characters).
  </li>
  <li>
    Display property set to standalone.
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>What Else ?</h5>

<p>The Service Worker and Manifest File are the two items that will really boost your score on the Lighthouse test, and which
  more and more websites are adapting each day. But there is another main feature required on your website, and actually
  a Service Worker won&rsquo;t even work on your website without this (unless you are working on localhost).
</p>

<h5>Https, Https &amp; Https</h5>

<p>Absolutely the most important item of a <abbr title="Progressive Web Application">PWA</abbr> and the Lighthouse report is
  having your website https enabled. With all the power that comes with having a service worker controlling the responses
  to all your requests, https is required. Even aside from that for just plain security and best practice, if your website
  is not https enabled &mdash; don&rsquo;t wait any longer and get that SSL Cert. Chrome will <a class="link--content" href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/10/avoid-not-secure-warn">soon</a>  display a security display a warning in the browser for any non-https websites which have a password or credit card (duh)
  input on their page .</p>

<h5>Ok really, what else ?</h5>

<p>Lighthouse is constantly updating the requirements to pass the report, so it&rsquo;s a good idea to check your website every
  few weeks even if you pass everything incase something new has popped up. Plus it&rsquo;s a good regression test for any
  future releases. While I feel adding a Service Worker, Manifest and Https are the main wins to get your report green &mdash;
  there are lot&rsquo;s more smaller items. Page Load Performace is huge, and you will be checked for the amount of resources
  you load and how you load them.</p>

<p>But I hope with the pointers outlined here you can get closer to getting a 100 on the Lighthouse report, and if not on your
  current site it can help get a good head start for your next project !</p>
